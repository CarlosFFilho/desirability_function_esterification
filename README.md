# desirability_function_esterification

The desirability function is a statistical tool used in process optimization to evaluate and improve multiple responses simultaneously. It combines multiple response variables into a single measure, assigning relative weights to each response based on its importance. The desirability function allows engineers and data scientists to set goals for each response variable and find process conditions that maximize or minimize those goals simultaneously. This is crucial for efficient process optimization, as it takes into account the complex interactions between different variables and objectives, resulting in global and more robust improvements in industrial processes.

This project aims to build a application of the desirability function to choose input variables for optimizing the esterification process aimed at biodiesel production.
